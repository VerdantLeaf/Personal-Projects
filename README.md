# Personal-Projects

Last Updated: 10/15/24 

Figured I should at least put something in here, so went and uploaded the v1.2 and 1.3 of MARTHA. I did all of the development for 1.0-1.2, but handed that off to a junior member (Trevor) for 1.3. I was still heavily involved in the (re)-design and validation of the systems.

Secondly, I have begun my Verilog endeavor, however school is loving to get in the way. I decided to start with hdlbits.com, which has been pretty interesting, but also means that I can't upload stuff here - unless I maybe copy stuff over. That would be smart. 

I don't have any large personal coding projects at the time of writing. Unfortunately, pretty much everything I have written is either for school or proprietary.
