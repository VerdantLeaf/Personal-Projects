# Personal-Projects

Last Updated: 01/02/2025

Small update:

Ordered MARTHA 1.3, and outside of two small problems that we didn't catch, everything seems to be working as intended! That is pretty cool, especially with the almost ground up redesign that we did. 

HDLBits.com work is (partially) up on my profile, see the HDLBits repository here: https://github.com/VerdantLeaf/HDLBits

Still working on getting Vivado up and running with my Arty S7 board, but I am having to split my focus between that and Cadence digital badges.

I don't have any large personal coding projects at the time of writing. Unfortunately, pretty much everything I have written is either for school or proprietary.
