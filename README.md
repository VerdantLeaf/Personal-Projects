# Personal-Projects

Last Updated: 12/7/24 

Small update:

Ordered MARTHA 1.3, and outside of two small problems that we didn't catch, everything seems to be working as intended! That is pretty cool, especially with the almost ground up redesign that we did. 

Work and progress on Verilog / hdlbits.com / Vivado has been slow. This semester has kept me plenty busy, and I just haven't had the time. 

I don't have any large personal coding projects at the time of writing. Unfortunately, pretty much everything I have written is either for school or proprietary.
